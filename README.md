## Step 1: Data Cleaning

### 1. Convert Price Column
- **Problem**: The `Price` column contains dollar signs (`$`) and is stored as text, making it unusable for numerical analysis.
- **Solution**:
  1. Removed the dollar sign (`$`) using the **Find and Replace** feature in Excel:
     - Press `Ctrl + H`, type `$` in the **Find what** box, leave the **Replace with** box empty, and click **Replace All**.
  2. Converted the `Price` column to a numerical format:
     - Selected the column, navigated to **Home > Number Format**, and changed it to `Number` or `Currency`.
- **Outcome**: The `Price` column is now in a numerical format suitable for analysis.

### 2. Standardize Column Names
- **Problem**: Column names were inconsistent (e.g., mixed casing, spaces, special characters).
- **Solution**:
  - Renamed all column headers to follow a consistent naming convention:
    - Replaced spaces with underscores (e.g., `Monthly Charges` â†’ `monthly_charges`).
    - Converted all names to lowercase for uniformity.
    - Removed special characters.
- **Outcome**: Column names are standardized, making the dataset more readable and easier to use in formulas or code.

### 3. Check for Duplicates
- **Problem**: Duplicate rows can lead to inaccurate analysis.
- **Solution**:
  1. Selected the entire dataset in Excel.
  2. Used the **Remove Duplicates** feature:
     - Went to **Data > Remove Duplicates**, selected all columns, and clicked **OK**.
  3. Reviewed the results to ensure only duplicate rows were removed.
- **Outcome**: Duplicate rows were removed, ensuring unique entries in the dataset.

### 4. Handle Missing Data
- **Problem**: Missing values in the dataset can affect the accuracy of analysis.
- **Solution**:
  - Checked for missing values:
    - Used **Conditional Formatting** to highlight blanks:
      - **Home > Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cell Rules > Blanks**.
    - Filtered for blank cells in columns to locate them easily.
  - Addressed missing values:
    - Replaced missing numerical values (e.g., `Price`) with the column's average using:
      ```excel
      =AVERAGE(range)
      ```
    - Replaced missing categorical values with "Unknown" or "Not Available."
- **Outcome**: All missing values were handled appropriately, ensuring data completeness.

### Conclusion
After performing the above cleaning steps:
1. The dataset is free from inconsistencies in formatting or missing data.
2. It is now ready for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
